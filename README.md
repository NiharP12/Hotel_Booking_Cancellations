# Hotel_Booking_Cancellations

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze hotel booking data to identify trends, patterns, and key factors contributing to booking cancellations. By visualizing the data through an interactive dashboard, the project aims to help hotel management understand customer behavior, track cancellation rates across different hotel types, guest types, room preferences, and time periods, and derive actionable insights to reduce future cancellations and optimize booking strategies.
